* Find or create a replacement for the hkdf library in use now due to it using OpenSSL for SHA2 (NO OPENSSL IN CRYPTOE!)
* Create Cipher.py, support Serpent and Twofish in addition to AES. Create wrapper API if necessary, but try to use pycrypto's blockalgo if possible
* Ensure that CTR or CBC can be done with any supported cipher using the same methods with different flags
* I still want a C or Python implementation of CTR_DRBG, just for the sake of NIST purity
* Rework test db schema and functions for key storage now that wrapping and derivation is tested
