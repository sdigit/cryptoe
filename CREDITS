This project includes code from other sources, which are listed below. If your code is in here and I have not
given you credit, PLEASE submit a pull request! Some snippets did not contain a license, and it's certainly possible
that I overlooked some attribution that was due. If I have used code of yours that was not marked with a license, and
you do not wish for it to be included in a BSD licensed work, please let me know.

I may have added bugs. I won't make the original authors take credit for those.

1) The AES Key Wrap code in utils.py was first found here: https://gist.github.com/doublereedkurt/4243633
2) PyCrypto
3) RDRAND support is pulled from Intel's RDRAND library, with one change: clearing of the temporary random value in rdrand_get_bytes

I would like to thank the following people for placing their code in the public domain, without them this project would
not have been possible:
    Lorenz Quack
    Dwayne C. Litzenberger
